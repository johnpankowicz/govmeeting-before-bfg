# User Secrets
User Secrets are used to store information that should not be put in source control.
* Add Microsoft.Extensions.SecretManager.Tools to the tools section of the project.json file
* Run dotnet restore.
* A "UserSecretsId" will be added to the top of project.json. Its value is arbitrary, but is generally unique to the project.
* Add "builder.AddUserSecrets()" to the startup routine in startup.cs. 

### Adding secrets:
* Open a command prompt at the project root folder and use these commands:
* dotnet user-secrets --help
* dotnet user-secrets set MySecret ValueOfMySecret
* dotnet user-secrets list

User’s Secrets that get added using “Secret Manager Tool” are located in AppData of current logged in Windows users.
* C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UserSecrets/<userSecretsId>/secrets.json

For NON windows machine they are located at 
* ~/.microsoft/usersecrets/<userSecretsId>/secrets.json

You can access user secrets in code via the configuration API:
  * string testConfig = Configuration["MySecret"];

 ### Secrets that we added to the store
We added the following to the secret store:
 * ExternalAuth:Google:ClientId = ClientId for Google+ external authorization
 * ExternalAuth:Google:ClientSecret = ClientSecret for Google+
 Now this info does not get checked into source control.


 ### Deploying to production
When we publish the WebApp using the "Publish" dialog in Visual Studio, we will copy an appsettings.Production.json file
over to the Publish folder. The setting in this will override those in appsettings.json.
See the notes for "Deployment".
