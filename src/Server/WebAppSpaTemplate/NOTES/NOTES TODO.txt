=== WebApp ===

* [done] Switch over to using .NET Core1
	I renamed WebApp project "WebAppOld". I created a new WebApp selecting:
		ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core) -> Web Application, Auth = user accounts"
	Then I merged my changes in startup.cs with the new startup.cs.
	Most of the other source files in the project could be copied over from WebAppOld.
	These are the files in the folders "Controllers", "Models", "Services" and "Views".
	However, there were a couple of changes in the new files that I merged in.
	I needed to commment out code in Services\EmailService.cs and StatusRequirement.cs. There were build errors.
	Also, the new project has a new file "bundleconfig.json" containing tasks. This conflicts with the prior gulpfile.js.
	After solving a few problems, the project ran OK. But wwwroot did not include the BrowserApp dev output because
	of the problem with the conflicting build task files.

* [done] Solve conflict with bundleconfig.json and gulpfile.js. I [ I just removed the gulpfile ]

* [done] Move user secrets in appsettings.json to a file that is not put on GitHub.

* How does the first admin user get created? Where is the code for displaying the Admin button? Who sees it?

* [done] Get BrowserApp dev output to be included.

* Solve build problems in Services\EmailService.cs and StatusRequirement.cs. 

* Make versions of Typescript the same in VsCode and VS.
