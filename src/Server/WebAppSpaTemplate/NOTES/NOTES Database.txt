In Startup.cs, we configure:
	1. the default connection for SqlServer
	2. the Identity service to use Entity Framework.

	public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
		services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
			options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

		services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()
			.AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>() ...

Creating the first user (accessing the database for the first time)
	Launch the application and then click on the Register link.
	If this is the first time you're performing this action, you may be required to run migrations.
	The application prompts you to Apply Migrations.


View the database.
	* If your app is using a SQL Server database (the default on Windows and for Visual Studio users),
	you can view the database the app created. You can use SQL Server Management Studio.
	* Alternatively, from Visual Studio, select View -> SQL Server Object Explorer.
	Connect to (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB. The database with a name matching 
	aspnet-<name of your project>-<date string> is displayed.
	Expand the database and its Tables, then right-click the dbo.AspNetUsers table and select View Data.
