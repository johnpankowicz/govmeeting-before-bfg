Section and topic names can be moved by clicking on the up/down arrows.
Clicking on text opens a dialog box for entering a topic name. Highlighing words in the text pre-populates the input box.<br>
Right now you can add topic names anywhere. But it makes sense to limit this to certain sections of the meeting.
