    {"startTime":"7:07","speaker":null,"said":"let's get just so you know their next"},
    {"startTime":"7:11","speaker":null,"said":"step after that would be repaired design"},

    {"startTime":"7:29","speaker":null,"said":"capacity up to a public good at some"},
    {"startTime":"7:31","speaker":null,"said":"point so they will be recommending the"},
    {"startTime":"7:33","speaker":null,"said":"design so that all the contractors will"},
    {"startTime":"7:36","speaker":null,"said":"get on have the exact same"},
    {"startTime":"7:37","speaker":null,"said":"specifications they would also be"},
    {"startTime":"7:41","speaker":null,"said":"working with code enforcement officer"},
    {"startTime":"7:43","speaker":null,"said":"and taking a lead role with all the"},
    {"startTime":"7:44","speaker":null,"said":"permitting that might be necessary"},
    {"startTime":"7:46","speaker":null,"said":"that would include the dep Army Corps of"},
    {"startTime":"7:49","speaker":null,"said":"Engineers even the US Coast Guard and"},
    {"startTime":"7:53","speaker":null,"said":"and possibly a short lanzone permit"},
    {"startTime":"7:56","speaker":null,"said":"after that they will assist with the"},
    {"startTime":"8:00","speaker":null,"said":"with the big phase they will meet with"},
    {"startTime":"8:02","speaker":null,"said":"the contractors were bidding on the"},
    {"startTime":"8:05","speaker":null,"said":"project answer any questions so that"},
    {"startTime":"8:07","speaker":null,"said":"again everyone is still bidding on the"},
    {"startTime":"8:08","speaker":null,"said":"same thing as you can see the project"},
    {"startTime":"8:11","speaker":null,"said":"timeline here is not as quick as anybody"},
    {"startTime":"8:14","speaker":null,"said":"would like it to be but this"},
    {"startTime":"8:16","speaker":null,"said":"the project's bigger than just replacing"},
    {"startTime":"8:18","speaker":null,"said":"a few boards here in there and the"},
    {"startTime":"8:22","speaker":null,"said":"regulatory review they expect to have"},
    {"startTime":"8:24","speaker":null,"said":"done in November the final design ready"},
    {"startTime":"8:28","speaker":null,"said":"to go out to bid would be in december"},
    {"startTime":"8:30","speaker":null,"said":"and they anticipated construction target"},
    {"startTime":"8:32","speaker":null,"said":"date somewhere in january-february"},
    {"startTime":"8:34","speaker":null,"said":"that's the end of the week choose for"},
    {"startTime":"8:36","speaker":null,"said":"someone to do the work so that's the the"},
    {"startTime":"8:43","speaker":null,"said":"basics of where we are at the moment"},
    {"startTime":"8:44","speaker":null,"said":"they're having some questions about the"},
    {"startTime":"8:47","speaker":null,"said":"bridge get inspected"},
    {"startTime":"8:49","speaker":null,"said":"yes the footbridge gets inspected every"},
    {"startTime":"8:51","speaker":null,"said":"year and we also budget five thousand"},
    {"startTime":"8:54","speaker":null,"said":"dollars a year for repairs this"},
    {"startTime":"8:56","speaker":null,"said":"particular scope of work is something"},
    {"startTime":"8:58","speaker":null,"said":"outside what Public Works could do so"},
    {"startTime":"9:01","speaker":null,"said":"that's that's it for that answer any"},
    {"startTime":"9:04","speaker":null,"said":"questions people might have to do they"},
    {"startTime":"9:07","speaker":null,"said":"give us a quote for this effort for the"},
    {"startTime":"9:10","speaker":null,"said":"engineering part yeah yeah they said"},
    {"startTime":"9:13","speaker":null,"said":"nobilis as they go but it could go up as"},
    {"startTime":"9:16","speaker":null,"said":"high as nineteen thousand dollars and"},
    {"startTime":"9:18","speaker":null,"said":"that would get us the bid package that"},
    {"startTime":"9:20","speaker":null,"said":"would get us everything through the big"},
    {"startTime":"9:22","speaker":null,"said":"package together okay"},
    {"startTime":"9:23","speaker":null,"said":"is there an estimate of what they think"},
    {"startTime":"9:25","speaker":null,"said":"the administration of the project would"},
    {"startTime":"9:29","speaker":null,"said":"cost under the project costs included it"},
    {"startTime":"9:31","speaker":null,"said":"says that the construction services and"},
    {"startTime":"9:37","speaker":null,"said":"i'm assuming the management is going to"},
    {"startTime":"9:39","speaker":null,"said":"be covered so do we know what that would"},
    {"startTime":"9:40","speaker":null,"said":"be beyond we won't know that until we"},
    {"startTime":"9:42","speaker":null,"said":"get bids and yeah because they won't be"},
    {"startTime":"9:44","speaker":null,"said":"they won't be managing that will be"},
    {"startTime":"9:46","speaker":null,"said":"providing maybe technical assistance but"},
    {"startTime":"9:48","speaker":null,"said":"other than that it's going to be done by"},
    {"startTime":"9:49","speaker":null,"said":"shaper contractor gets the bid so it"},
    {"startTime":"9:52","speaker":null,"said":"will be significantly more expensive"},
    {"startTime":"9:53","speaker":null,"said":"than this"},
    {"startTime":"9:55","speaker":null,"said":"the good news is that you'll hear in the"},
    {"startTime":"9:56","speaker":null,"said":"evening the audit couple weeks is that"},
    {"startTime":"9:59","speaker":null,"said":"we're in a very good position"},
    {"startTime":"10:01","speaker":null,"said":"financially or undesignated fund"},
    {"startTime":"10:03","speaker":null,"said":"balances two million dollars so the"},
    {"startTime":"10:07","speaker":null,"said":"financing part of that don't think it"},
    {"startTime":"10:08","speaker":null,"said":"was particularly the challenge"},
    {"startTime":"10:10","speaker":null,"said":"it's the process of going through the"},
    {"startTime":"10:12","speaker":null,"said":"public bidding process of selecting"},
    {"startTime":"10:14","speaker":null,"said":"winners and so forth that slows it down"},
    {"startTime":"10:16","speaker":null,"said":"so Tom in the background report it says"},
    {"startTime":"10:22","speaker":null,"said":"the swing span has remained closed for"},
    {"startTime":"10:26","speaker":null,"said":"20 years so if it's remained closed for"},
    {"startTime":"10:31","speaker":null,"said":"20 years my assumption would be that"},
    {"startTime":"10:33","speaker":null,"said":"there wouldn't be much human cry or at"},
    {"startTime":"10:37","speaker":null,"said":"least necessity to plan to reconstruct"},
    {"startTime":"10:41","speaker":null,"said":"this with the capacity of swinging"},
    {"startTime":"10:44","speaker":null,"said":"that's why I at least have them start"},
    {"startTime":"10:46","speaker":null,"said":"with a fixed structure we have to get"},
    {"startTime":"10:48","speaker":null,"said":"the ball rolling I didn't want to wait"},
    {"startTime":"10:49","speaker":null,"said":"till the next elections meeting give him"},
    {"startTime":"10:51","speaker":null,"said":"one way or the other but again that's"},
    {"startTime":"10:52","speaker":null,"said":"kind of lacking that can change that the"},
    {"startTime":"10:55","speaker":null,"said":"cost would go up obviously to put a"},
    {"startTime":"10:57","speaker":null,"said":"gearing mechanism underrated opened"},
    {"startTime":"10:59","speaker":null,"said":"again in our discussions with Barney"},
    {"startTime":"11:03","speaker":null,"said":"Baker we've pointed out that the spans"},
    {"startTime":"11:07","speaker":null,"said":"underneath the bridge have to remain as"},
    {"startTime":"11:09","speaker":null,"said":"they are you can't put pilings in there"},
    {"startTime":"11:11","speaker":null,"said":"now because everyone who has floats on"},
    {"startTime":"11:13","speaker":null,"said":"the inside wouldn't be able to get them"},
    {"startTime":"11:14","speaker":null,"said":"out for those get taken out the winner"},
    {"startTime":"11:16","speaker":null,"said":"and brought back in so we're proposing"},
    {"startTime":"11:18","speaker":null,"said":"to leave it just as it is now with the"},
