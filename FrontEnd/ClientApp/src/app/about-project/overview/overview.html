  To keep imformed of local town or city government activities, attending regular Council meetings is the primary first step.
  It is here where bills are introduced, debated and ultimately voted on. Here is where new issues are introduced. Here
  formal reports from the department heads are read and discussed.
</p>

<h2>The Before</h2>

But getting access to this information is not easy:

<p>Perhaps some of have time to attend or watch all of two to three hour meetings But usually only a few minutes of each may be relevant to us.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are meeting minutes on government websites. But these are missing the important discusssions.</p>
<p>If this is a large city, perhaps there are transcripts available.
      But they are usually not user friendly.
  <p>
  Here is a sample page from a Philadelphia transcript.
  It is 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. It is also in PDF format,
  making it unusable on small screens.
  Click: <button (click)="ToggleTranscript()"> {{showhidetranscript}} Sample Transcript </button>
<img [hidden]="!CheckShowTranscript()" (click)="ToggleTranscript()" src="/assets/images/Philly transcript page.png" width="900" alt="Philadelphia transcript page">

<p>
  Finding information is difficult. There is no table of contents. There is a computer generated single-word index.
  But it is meant for a legal researcher, not the average person. Click:
  <button (click)="ToggleIndex()"> {{showhideindex}} Sample Index </button>

</p>

<h2> The After</h2>

<p>
  Most other "Open Government" projects rely on government supplied data. Govmeeting takes the opposite approach.
  It will use governement data if available. But if government can't or won't supply the needed
  data, it provides a way for citizens themselves to create the data that it needs to monitor government actions.
</p>

<p>
Govmeeting will generate transcipts of government meetings, extract the information and populate a database.
It will use a combination of artificial intelligence and user input to add meta-data to the transcripts.
  Then you will be able to do the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Go to a page where you see a list of all matters discussed at the meeting. </li>
  <ul>
    <li> General issues </li>
    <li> Bills and Resolutions </li>
    <li> Formal reports </li>
    <li> Public comment </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Click on any matter and see all that was said on it. </li>
  <li> Click on the name of a speaker and see what he/she said. </li>
  <li> Do combinations of the above (see what someone said on a specific matter). </li>
  <li> Expand the criteria to past meetings. See everything ever said on something. </li>
  <li> See activity on bills and resolutions - when they are introduced, debated and voted upon. </li>
  <li> Click on a bill to see all past activity on it. </li>
  <li> See the results of all current and past votes. </li>
  <li> View specific reports from department heads, etc </li>
  <li> Receive a summary of activity for each meeting via text message or email. </li>
  <li> Sign up to receive a email or text whenever specific matters are discussed in the future.</li>
  <li> See statistics that compare matters for number of alerts on them, etc .</li>
  <li> See statistics that compare attendence and involvement of elected officials.</li>
  <li> Use graphical tools to view statistics.</li>
  <li> Hear any part of any prior meeting (depends on bandwidth). </li>
</ul>
