As new government entities are added, this software will need to be tweaked. Pages on which the data is found can greatly vary and will need some custumization. Once enough individual cases are properly handled, the software can be improved to start to handle new variants automatically.

We can help the speech API by providing a custom dictionary of "hints" for terms we expect to find in common meeting dialogue.

Many people don't realize much closed-captioning text is not produced by a machine, but by a human. Specially trained people operate a system where they press keys that correspond to phonetic sounds. They are able to do this at real-time, at the same speed as the spoken text.




# Govmeeting.org

The site "govmeeting.org" will provide a instance of the software that any municipality can use freely to host and process their transcripts. Local volunteers can register their own municipality to have their transcripts processed and hosted here.

But also any person or municipality can  elect to run this open-source software on their own hosts.

Currently "govmeeting.org" is run on a low-cost shared host. Hopefully, as many municipalities elect to use this site, it will need to be run on a cloud service like AWS or Azure, in order to dynamically increase capacity.
