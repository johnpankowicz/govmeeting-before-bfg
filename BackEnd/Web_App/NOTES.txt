*** Command Task Runner in Visual Studio *** 
The Command Task Runner by Mads Kristensen enables shell commands to be added to Task Runner Explorer.
To add a command: Right-click on the command file in Solutions Explorer and select "Add to Task Runner".
This adds it to the file "commands.json" in either the root of the project where the command is located,
or in the root of the solution, if it in a folder outside of a project.

*** Other way to add tasks to Task Runner Explorer ***
If you create a package.json file in any project folder, scripts that you add to this will appear in TRE.
For example, create package.json in the Web_App folder and put this in it:
    { "scripts": { "buildclient": "cd ../../FrontEnd/ClientApp && npm run build" } }
"buildclient" will appear in TRE and can be added as a Before Build task. However, unless all the Before Build tasks
are within package.json, it is difficult (impossible?) to change the order with others. For example, it seems impossible
to have this "buildclient" task run before the command task "Copy-ClientAssets.ps1".
